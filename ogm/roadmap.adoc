Hibernate OGM is community driven and as such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs.
You can find a finer grained roadmap in our https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM[issue tracker] but this page is a good and concise view of where we are going.
Dates are generally omitted, we release when we are ready.
