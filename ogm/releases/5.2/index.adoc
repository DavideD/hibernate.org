=== Project organization

We have split the dialects in 2:

 * the ones maintained in the main repository: Infinispan, MongoDB, Neo4j
 * the ones maintained by the community which have been moved to separate repositories: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-cassandra[Cassandra], https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-couchdb[CouchDB], https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-ehcache[EhCache], https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-ignite[Apache Ignite] and https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm-redis[Redis]

=== Core

OGM now requires Java 8 or later.

=== Datastores

==== Infinispan

 * Upgrade to Infinispan 9.1
 * Create caches when needed with Infinispan Remote via Hot Rod
 * Use Infinspan Clustered Counters for sequences and id generation with Infinispan Embedded
 * Operation grouping: OGM automatically groups write operations when it is possible.

==== MongoDB

 * We upgraded to the MongoDB 3 API
 * Use MongoDB Driver version 3.6
 * Support GeoSpatial data type
 * Support distinct operations in native queries
 * Support Map/Reduce operations in native queries
 * Remove Fongo dialect as it wasn't really useful and it generated some maintenance burden

==== Neo4j

 * Fixed a few bugs related to some specific mappings
 * Performance improvements
