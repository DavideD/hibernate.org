== Upgrade to Hibernate Search {to_version_short}.x from {from_version_short}.x

The aim of this guide is to assist you migrating an existing application using any version `{from_version_short}.x` of Hibernate Search to the latest of the `{to_version_short}.x` series.

* As of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3039[HSEARCH-3039],
Embedded IDs are no longer analyzed.
Embedded IDs are properties defined as `@DocumentId` (or, lacking that, JPA's `@Id`),
then embedded in another document using `@IndexedEmbedded(includeEmbeddedObjectId = true)`
or `@IndexedEmbedded(includePaths = { ..., "<the ID property name>", ... })`.
