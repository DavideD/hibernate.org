=== JSR 352 (Batch for Java) mass indexing job

A JSR 352 mass indexing job was added, adding in particular the ability to restart
from a checkpoint when indexing fails.

See https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.9/reference/en-US/html_single/#jsr352-integration[the documentation]
for more information.
