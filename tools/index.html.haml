          Hibernate Tools is a toolset for Hibernate3 implemented as an integrated suite of
          http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse] plugins,
          together with a unified Ant task for integration into the build cycle.
          Hibernate Tools is a core component of http://jboss.org/tools[JBoss Tools]
          and hence also part of http://www.jboss.com/products/devstudio[JBoss Developer Studio].

          The following features are available within Eclipse.

          === Mapping Editor
          
          An editor for Hibernate XML mapping files, supporting auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
          The editor even supports semantic auto-completion for class names, property/field names, table names and column names.

          === Console

          The Hibernate Console perspective allows you to configure database connections,
          provides visualization of classes and their relationships
          and allows you to execute HQL queries interactively against your database and browse the query results.

          === Reverse Engineering

          The most powerful feature of Hibernate Tools is a database reverse engineering tool
          that can generate domain model classes and Hibernate mapping files, annotated EJB3 entity beans, HTML documentation
          or even an entire JBoss Seam application in seconds!
