    == Reactive Object/Relational Mapping

    Hibernate Reactive is a reactive API for Hibernate ORM, supporting non-blocking database drivers and a reactive style
    of interaction with the database.

    Hibernate Reactive is intended for use in a reactive programming environment like Vert.x or Quarkus, where interaction
    with the database should occur in a non-blocking fashion. Persistence operations are orchestrated via the construction
    of a reactive stream rather than via direct invocation of synchronous functions in procedural Java code.

    JDBC, JPA and Hibernate ORM use blocking IO for interaction with the database, and are therefore not appropriate for
    use in a reactive environment. Hibernate Reactive is a feature rich ORM implementation designed to take advantage of
    non-blocking database clients. PostgreSQL, MySQL, and DB2 are supported via the Vert.x client libraries.

    == Compatibility
