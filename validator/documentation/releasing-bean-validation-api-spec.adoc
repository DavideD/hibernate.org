:awestruct-layout: project-standard
:awestruct-project: validator

Follow these steps for an official release.

WARNING: Bean Validation has been moved to Jakarta EE thus this release process needs an update.

=== Prerequisites

* You need to have access to http://ci.hibernate.org/: the release process is now driven by CI
* Follow the order of operations - the API has to be released before the specification
 
=== Prepare

* Make sure there are no outstanding issues in https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/BVAL/issues[Jira]
* Release the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/BVAL?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=released-unreleased[Jira version]
 
=== Release beanvalidation-api

==== Prepare

* Check that everything has been pushed to the upstream repository
* Check that CI is green for the branch you want to release
* Before you release try the latest snapshot of the API with the RI (if the RI is up to date with the API)

==== Release

* Go to CI, and select http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Validator/job/beanvalidation-api-release/[the beanvalidation-api-release job]. Click on _Build with parameters_.
** *Be careful when filling the form with the build parameters*
** *Fill in the DELIVERY_QUALIFIER if the release is an official JCP release step (use - if not)*
* Release the artifacts on the JBoss Nexus repository manager. This is a two-steps process.
** Log into https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html[Nexus] and examine https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#stagingRepositories[your staging repository]. Click on the _Updated_ column 2 times to have the repositories sorted correctly.
** You can either drop it in order to start over again or you can close and promote it making the artifacts available in the live repository. (Click _Refresh_ after each action)
** You can find more information in the description of https://developer.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14608[the JBoss project release process]. A Maven settings.xml for testing the artifacts in the staging repository can be found https://developer.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15664[here].
* Transfer the released issues in JIRA to the _Closed_ state. You can use this search https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/BVAL-560?jql=project%20%3D%20BVAL%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%202.0.0.Alpha2%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC[Issue Navigator - Hibernate JIRA] and select another `fixVersion`. Once you have selected the right version, click on the button with three dots at the top right of the screen and click on _Bulk update all XX issues_. Use the _Transition_ action to transition your issues from _Resolved_ to _Closed_.

=== Release beanvalidation-spec

==== Prepare

* Check that everything has been pushed to the upstream repository
* Check that you are able to build the TCK audit file via the command ant create-tck-audit-file (a section id might be missing)
* Check that CI is green for the branch you want to release
* *The changelog of the spec is now updated automatically: do not update it!*

==== Release

* Go to CI, and select http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Validator/job/beanvalidation-spec-release/[the beanvalidation-spec-release job]. Click on _Build with parameters_.
** *Be careful when filling the form with the build parameters.*
** *Fill in the RELEASE_VERSION_QUALIFIER if the release is an official JCP release step*
** *Fill in the DELIVERY_QUALIFIER if the release is an official JCP release step (use - if not)*
* The release job pushes the specification to the website repository but there are still some manual steps:
** Update the home page: http://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation - Home]
** Update the specification page: http://beanvalidation.org/specification/[Bean Validation - Specification]
** Once the spec is online (ie the website job triggered by the release job is finished), you can generate the HTML diffs using: https://www.changedetection.com/comparepages.html[ChangeDetection - Compare Web Pages]
