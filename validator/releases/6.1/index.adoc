=== Jakarta Bean Validation

Hibernate Validator 6.1 uses the Jakarta Bean Validation API artifact i.e. `jakarta.validation:jakarta.validation-api`.

No API changes.

=== Quarkus-tailored bootstrap

To better fit Quarkus architecture, we have developed a new bootstrap that allows to collect the Hibernate Validator metadata at build time.

This allows to drastically reduce the Hibernate Validator contribution to the Quarkus startup time.

=== Performance and memory footprint improvements

Hibernate Validator 6.1 comes with some new performance and memory footprint improvements.
