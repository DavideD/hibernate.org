=== Jakarta Bean Validation 3.0

Hibernate Validator 7.0 is the reference implementation for Jakarta Bean Validation 3.0.

The main change is that all the dependencies using `javax.` packages are now using `jakarta.*` packages.

Upgrade to Hibernate Validator 7 is only recommended if you are moving to Jakarta EE 9.

=== Expression Language overhaul (also in 6.2)

Expression Language disabled by default for custom violations.

Ability to define the Expression Language features enabled for more safety.

=== @SafeHtml removal (also in 6.2)

The `@SafeHtml` constraint marked as deprecated for a while has been dropped from the codebase.
