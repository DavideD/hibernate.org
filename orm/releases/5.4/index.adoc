=== EntityGraph improvements

Hibernate ORM 5.4 adds 2 new features to help make working with EntityGraphs easier:

 * EntityGraph parsing
 * EntityGraph manipulation

The entry point for these 2 features is the `org.hibernate.graph.EntityGraphs` class.

=== JDK 11 support

Hibernate ORM now supports JDK 11 out of the box.
