=== JDBC Performance

6.0 switches reading from JDBC `ResultSet` by name to reading by position.  This
required significant changes to the Hibernate type system.


=== HQL Translation Performance

6.0 switched from Antlr v2 to Antlr v4 for its HQL translation.  Antlr v4
itself is more performant.  Additionally we refactored the grammars to be
more efficient


=== Criteria Translation Performance

In previous versions of Hibernate, JPA Criteria queries were translated by
first rendering the Criteria as an HQL query.  6.0 changes this so that
HQL and Criteria are both translated into the same form : the Semantic Query
Model (SQM).
