= How to build hibernate.org
:awestruct-layout: title-nocol
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble

A bit of Git, a bit of Ruby and you will get your local hibernate.org served.

== Prerequisites

* Get http://git-scm.com[Git]
* Get https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] > 1.9
* If on Mac OS:
** Get https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[XCode] (needed for compilation of native gems)
* If on Linux:
** Get _libxslt-dev_ - eg via `sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev` (may be called _libxslt1-dev_
for some distros)

== Installation

=== Ensure Rake is installed

Make sure https://github.com/jimweirich/rake[Rake] is available. It is often installed per default.

[source]
----
> rake --version
----

If you get "_command not found_":

[source]
----
> gem install rake
----

=== Ensure Bundler is installed

Make sure http://bundler.io/[Bundler] is available. It manages your Ruby gems locally to the project
and prevents version conflicts between different Ruby projects. To quote from the website:

____
Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact
gems and versions that are needed.
____

[source]
----
> bundle -v
----

If you get "_command not found_":

[source]
----
> gem install bundler
----

=== Get the source

[source]
----
> git clone git@github.com:hibernate/hibernate.org.git
> cd hibernate.org
----

=== Setup awestruct

[source]
----
> rake setup
> rake check
----

=== Serve the site

[source]
----
rake preview
----

Point your browser to http://localhost:4242

== Tips & Tricks

=== Which other tasks exist in the Rake build file?

[source]
----
> rake --tasks
----

This will list the available tasks with a short description

=== I am getting errors when trying to execute *awestruct* directly

You need to use `bundle exec <command>` to make sure you get all required Gems. Check the *Rakefile*
to see how the different awestruct calls are wrapped.

=== If your changes are not visible...

Panic! Then completely regenerate the site via:

[source]
----
> rake clean preview
----

=== If serving the site is slow...

On Linux, serving the file may be atrociously slow (something to do with WEBRick).

Use the following alternative:

* Go in your `hibernate.org` directory.
* Run  `awestruct --auto -P development`
* In parallel, go to the `hibernate.org/_site` directory
* Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4242`

You should be back to millisecond serving :)
